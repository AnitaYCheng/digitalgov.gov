# Using the do and don'ts table

{{< do-dont-table caption="This is a table" >}}
  {{< do-dont-row do="do this today." dont="don't do this today." >}}
  {{< do-dont-row do="open the door for those who need a hand" dont="use inappropriate language in the chats" >}}
  {{< do-dont-row do="read the directions before using" dont="forget to wash your hands for 20 seconds" >}}
{{< /do-dont-table >}}


## Please follow the rules

When setting up a **do-dont-table**, you need to make sure you have the correct formatting.

* Start with a a **do-dont-table** then nest **do-dont-row**
* When you don't provide a matching pair for **do** or **don't**, the table row will not appear. Make sure you have both.
* Make sure to close the **do-dont't table** with a closing tag, it is not needed for the **do-dont-row**
