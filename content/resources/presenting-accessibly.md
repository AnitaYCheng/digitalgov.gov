To meet Section 508 requirements for accessibility, speakers should provide “audio descriptions” throughout their presentations. Read these tips on how to create accessible multimedia content and make audio descriptions for more information.

* Speak slowly and clearly.
* Keep your camera on. This allows people to see you, including those who lip read.
* Announce the slide number instead of saying “next slide.” 
* To meet [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/manage/laws-and-policies) requirements for accessibility, provide “audio descriptions” as follows: 
* Say your name each time you begin to speak, or announce the new speaker when there is a speaker change.
* Describe all images on the slides.
* Speak to the text on the slides including any links referenced on the slides.

Using audio descriptions doesn't mean reading your slides word-for-word, or describing every little mark; however, you must describe the information that is important for understanding the content.

Read these Section 508 tips on how to [create accessible multimedia content](https://www.section508.gov/create/synchronized-media#audio-description) and [make audio descriptions](https://digital.gov/2014/06/30/508-accessible-videos-how-to-make-audio-descriptions/) for more information.

As always, we will provide live captioning during the event, so remember to slow down your speech when giving your presentation.

Please reach out to us with any questions, and for specific IT accessibility questions, Agency 508 Program Managers (PMs) should be your first point of contact.
