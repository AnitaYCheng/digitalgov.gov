This checklist is for people preparing to present at a Digital.gov event. You may find these guidelines helpful when presenting at other meetings and events, too.

## Preparing your presentation

* Make your points relevant to federal employees, the primary audience for our events.
* Follow [Digital.gov Community Guidelines](https://digital.gov/communities/manage-your-subscription/). Don’t express your political or religious views or use inappropriate language.
* Use plain language in both your slides and speech.
* Follow the “less is more” principle. Use fewer slides, fewer images, and less text.
* Expect some re-work after submitting slides. Be available to make edits.

## Presentation slide requirements

* Submit slides 5 days before event to [digitalgov@gsa.gov](mailto:digitalgov@gsa.gov). Copy the event hosts.
* Submit slides in PowerPoint format.
* Keep the file size under 25 MB.
* Optimize images by selecting an image, clicking on “Picture Format tab → Compress Pictures → On-screen (150 ppi).” Select the option, “All pictures in this file.” 
* Run the [accessibility checker in PowerPoint](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/make-your-powerpoint-presentations-accessible-to-people-with-disabilities-6f7772b2-2f33-4bd2-8ca7-dae3b2b3ef25) before submitting slides; remediate all errors and warnings, including reading order. Reach out to [your agency's 508 Program Manager](https://www.section508.gov/tools/program-manager-listing/) if you need any help.
* Meet accessibility requirements, including:
   * Use large text
   * Use typefaces (fonts) that are easy to read like Source Sans Pro or Merriweather.
   * Limit the amount of text to include only your main points. Avoid extra text that you don’t plan to speak to.
   * Use text that has a readable [color contrast](https://www.section508.gov/training/documents/aed-cop-docx12/) against background colors
   * Avoid complicated visuals such as patterned backgrounds, overlapping photos or graphics.
   * Don’t include visuals that you won’t be speaking about.
   * Include slide numbers on every slide.
   * Include [alt text](https://www.section508.gov/training/presentations/aed-cop-pptx07/) for every image.

Watch these [presentations training videos](https://www.section508.gov/create/presentations/training-videos) for more information on creating accessible presentations.

* Link to government websites by default.
* Follow the [GSA Linking Policy](https://www.gsa.gov/website-information/website-policies#linking) if you link to any non-government sites; all non-government links will require additional review and approval.
* Recommend and link to books, papers, or studies published by the federal government only. Do not recommend or link to content published by other organizations.
* Do not include any potentially sensitive or personally identifiable information (PII), including the presenter’s geographic location, age, birthday, etc.
* Do not use copyrighted images, pictures, graphics unless your agency owns the image rights.
* Do not name (endorse) commercial products, services, or non-federal organizations.
* Do not use non-government logos such as Google, Twitter, Microsoft, etc.
* Use your .gov or .mil emails if you provide contact information for presenters. Do not list non-government company names or contact information.
* Share official agency accounts if you provide any social media accounts. Do not use non-government accounts such as your personal LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.

## Day of presentation

* Dress professionally (business casual).
* Speak slowly and clearly.
* Keep your camera on. This allows people to see you, including those who lip read.
* Announce the slide number instead of saying “next slide.”
* To meet [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/manage/laws-and-policies) requirements for accessibility, provide “audio descriptions” as follows:
   * Say your name each time you begin to speak, or announce the new speaker when there is a speaker change
   * Describe all images on the slides
   * Speak to the text on the slides including any links referenced on the slides
   * Describe the information that is important for understanding the content
   * Try not to read your slides word-for-word

Read these tips on how to [create accessible multimedia content](https://www.section508.gov/create/synchronized-media#audio-description) and [make audio descriptions](https://digital.gov/2014/06/30/508-accessible-videos-how-to-make-audio-descriptions/) for more information.

## Additional guidelines for presenters who aren’t federal employees

* We’ll send you Model Release and Gratuitous Service forms. Complete and return them to us as soon as you receive them.
* Do not advertise or appear to advertise your organization or its products or services.
* When referring to your role, state that you’re a contractor with XYZ federal agency. Do not identify your company by name.
* Share official agency accounts if you provide any social media accounts. Do not use non-government social media accounts.
* Use your .gov or .mil email if you provide your contact information. Do not list your private company contact information.
