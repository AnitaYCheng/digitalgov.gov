If you are speaking at a Digital.gov hosted event, please read these instructions carefully to ensure compliance of your slides and speaking points. We ask that you submit your accessible PowerPoint slides (not PDFs, Google Slides, etc.) to the Digital.gov team at least 5 business days before the event.

The Digital.gov team will then review the slides for accessibility, endorsement, copyright, etc. and post the slides on Digital.gov at least one day before the event.

Speakers and/or hosts should run the accessibility checker in PowerPoint before submitting their slides. 

Make sure the slides: 

* Use large text
* Limit the amount of text to include only your main points; avoid extra text that you don’t plan to speak to 
* Use text that has a color that is readable from a color contrast perspective
* Avoid complicated visuals 
* Don’t include visuals that you won’t be speaking to
* Include slide numbers on every slide
* Include [alt-text](https://www.section508.gov/training/presentations/aed-cop-pptx07/) for every image 

We advise against using videos or demos in your presentation, unless you are certain that they are completely accessible from a Section 508 standpoint. Let us know if you have questions about this.

Training videos on creating accessible presentations are located in [Section 508 Video Training](https://www.section508.gov/create/presentations/training-videos).
