## What is plain language?

Plain language is communication that is clear and easy to understand for your target audience, regardless of the medium used to deliver it. [PlainLanguage.gov](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/about/definitions/) defines it as communication your audience can understand the first time they read or hear it.

But plain language, which is often used interchangeably for plain English or plain writing, is not just best practice or common sense, it is also the law. The [Plain Writing Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-274)](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-111publ274/content-detail.html) defines plain writing as: “writing that is clear, concise, well-organized, and follows other best practices appropriate to the subject or field and intended audience.”

## Why use plain language on government websites?

Using plain language on government websites is one of the best ways to reach your target audience, because people usually search for information using everyday words (not [jargon](https://digital.gov/2022/11/07/jargon-madness-a-plain-language-exercise/)). A clear, concise message [builds trust with users](https://digital.gov/2022/12/13/to-build-trust-aim-for-easy/) because they can understand your call to action and complete tasks quickly.

Plain language also bridges information gaps between people who may read at different levels, process information at different speeds, or have a [different expertise](https://digital.gov/2022/11/09/tips-for-communicating-about-your-research-with-non-scientists/). This can also be very helpful when content needs to be translated in multiple languages, as translators are most often generalists.

By law, federal agencies must:

1. Provide clear communication to the public about government information related to benefits, services, and how to comply with a requirement the federal government administers or enforces.
2. Designate one or more points of contact for the implementation of the law and train their staff to use plain language.
3. Include a [dedicated plain language section](https://digital.gov/resources/required-web-content-and-links/#about-page-2)  that is accessible from the primary website’s homepage that lets the public know about how the agency is complying with this law

| Note: The Plain Writing Act of 2010 does not apply to the text of official regulations.  |

## How to get started with plain language

For web writers, editors, designers, producers or other digital professionals working for a federal website or digital service, using plain language and enforcing the Plain Writing Act are ongoing tasks.

 If you are new to the team, get started:

* Take any training already available from your agency.
* Get to know your agency’s designated [plain language contact](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/law/agency-programs/).
* Learn the existing plain language review process for public communication, and understand your role and responsibilities.
* Access existing tools and reports the team uses for accessibility and readability.
