## Self Descriptions Matter.

Self-descriptions are one way to make your events more inclusive. We want to reiterate that self-descriptions are just that: *one way* to make events more inclusive. It’s not necessary to require other people to provide self-descriptions, which are a matter of personal comfort on what a person chooses to share.  If you choose to describe yourself during your introduction to the group, you are taking steps to include participants that may not be able to see you. Additionally, what you choose to describe could help your audience connect with you, and understand that we’re all bringing multiple identities and perspectives to the event. Consider these examples of self-introductions. 

> Hi! My name is Jodie. Before I begin — to increase accessibility and inclusivity in our conversation today — I'm sharing a little bit about myself. My pronouns are she/her. I’m a recent breast cancer survivor with shoulder-length blonde hair, and I’m wearing a pop of pink for Breast Cancer Awareness Month. 
>
> My name is Tia. I use she/they pronouns. I’m an East Asian person with medium length blue hair with bangs. I’m wearing a black shirt with a gray hoodie, and I’m in my office which has white walls, and there are a couple of doors behind me.
>
> Hi, I'm Bridget, and I'm a content strategist. My pronouns are she/her, and I have white skin and chin-length gray hair. I have my background blurred.

These self-descriptions help people who may not be able to see the presentation know some of the context and identity markers of the presenters. They also let attendees know that this is a space where people of different health statuses, ages, gender identities, family types, etc. are present and leading the conversation. There is a subtext within these introductions that turns sharing personal identity into a way to ensure that the event feels inclusive and welcoming to others. 

## What to include in your self-description

What you include in your self-description is up to you. Some possibilities are:

* Clothing color or background
* Personal identity
* Preferred pronouns \[link to resource]

When you use self-description, keep in mind these best practices:

* Practice. Practice getting comfortable with using self-description, and ask for feedback before and after using self-description.
* Take context into consideration. \[to come–can reviewers help me with some situations that self-description may not be helpful or appropriate?]
* Listen. Make sure you’re following leading conversations on Slack, LinkedIn, and other professional platforms about best practices for inclusivity. Things change as we learn and share more.

Conversations are happening more and more often in the virtual world, and we are learning all the time about ways to make these digital spaces more inclusive and accessible. Using self-description in your introductions is one way to support creating strong, inclusive digital spaces.
