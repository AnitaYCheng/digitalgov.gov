## Call for Presenters

The User Experience (UX) Community of Practice is seeking submissions for presentations at the 2022 Government UX Summit, to be held June 7-8, 2022. Submissions should be on topics of interest to the federal UX community and general public. Instructions and additional information are below.

A committee of government employees will review the submissions and select the presentations for the program based on the relevance, usefulness, and quality of the submission and qualifications of the presenters. We expect to finalize the program in May.

See example presentations from the [2019 Government UX Summit](https://digital.gov/event/2019/05/15/2019-government-ux-summit/), [2020 Government UX Summit](https://digital.gov/event/2020/07/28/2020-government-ux-summit/), and [2021 Government UX Summit](https://digital.gov/event/2021/06/22/2021-user-experience-summit/).

### Considerations for Submitters

1. Presentations must be focused on U.S. federal government work (such as a federal government UX case study, a federal agency UX initiative, etc.). Federal employees must be included and identified as the lead speaker.
2. Presentation materials must be accessible, following the [Revised Section 508 Standards](https://www.section508.gov/create/). Those needing assistance to make their materials accessible should [contact their agency’s 508 Program Manager](https://www.section508.gov/tools/coordinator-listing/).
3. During the event, presenters must follow [Digital.gov’s Accessible Event Tips](https://github.com/GSA/digitalgov.gov/wiki/Accessible-Event-Tips), providing audio descriptions for images, reciting names for speaker changes, identifying slide numbers for audience members, etc.
4. Presentation materials must follow all [Digital.gov Community Guidelines](https://digital.gov/communities/manage-your-subscription/), including not endorsing private companies, brands, programs, or tools, and they must not contain any copyrighted images or materials.
5. Presenters must submit the final version of their presentation at least one week before the summit. Presentation materials used during the summit will be posted to the Digital.gov event page before the summit begins.
6. Videos of the sessions will not be posted. Instead, accepted presenters will be invited to share a 5-minute talk giving the highlights of their presentation at a follow-up, one-hour event on June 15.

### Submission of materials

*All submissions should have a focus on UX work in the U.S. federal government, or tie in to federal UX work.*
