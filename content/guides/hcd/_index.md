# Welcome!

The Human-Centered Design (HCD) Guides are intended to enhance the understanding and practice of human-centered design throughout the federal government. In this guide series, we will explore the four phases of HCD work: **discovery, design, delivery,** and **measurement**.

Each phase has been split up into two guidesâ€”a concepts guide to explain the underlying principles of that phase, and an operations guide to explain the best ways to go about implementing it.

To get started, you can <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="js-glossary-toggle">read through our glossary of important terms</a> or check out the guides below!
