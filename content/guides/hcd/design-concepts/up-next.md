## Deliver phase

You’ve drawn on your discovery phase work and created prototypes from it. You’ve tested those prototypes with participants. You’ve kept your leadership informed. You’ve worked with the implementation team to make sure the work will see lift-off.

The team is set up for success. Next, work with the implementation team to move into the deliver phase and see your work enter the world at scale!

_This four-phase diagram shows the Human-Centered Design process. The four phases shown in the circles are: discovery, design, deliver, and measure. These phases are sequential with the expectation that the process as a whole will be cyclical. Each part builds on and references each other, and teams can revisit previous phases as they find the need or investigate different aspects of their project._
