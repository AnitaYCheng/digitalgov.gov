Digital.gov, a service of the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), manages several [Communities of Practice](https://digital.gov/communities/). GSA provides Listservs and other channels to facilitate conversations among community members. By voluntarily participating in these communities, you are agreeing to abide by these Community Guidelines and the [TTS Code of Conduct](https://handbook.tts.gsa.gov/code-of-conduct/).

We strive to maintain inclusive, professional communities that engage in on-topic discussions. Severe or repeated violations of the guidelines and code of conduct may result in temporary or permanent removal from the Communities of Practice. If you do not agree to abide by the guidelines and code of conduct, email us at [digitalgov@gsa.gov](mailto:digitalgov@gsa.gov), and we will unsubscribe you from the Listservs.

## Rules and Guidelines for Discussions

- Members of a Community must use official .gov or .mil email addresses, and understand that they are acting in their official capacities represented through their U.S. government agencies.
- Understand your agency's policy about using all government equipment.
- Behave online in such a way that you do not bring your agency into disrepute, even if you are not officially representing your agency.
- Keep the conversation relevant and abide by the [TTS Code of Conduct](https://handbook.tts.gsa.gov/code-of-conduct/). Respect your peers. Any derogatory comments on race, disability, sexuality, and more will not be tolerated. No inappropriate language or personal attacks.
- Do not participate in commercial communications or endorsements. No commercial communications or endorsements are permitted.
- Check your current agency policies on managing records. Find more information on the [National Archives Records Management Information Page](https://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt).
- Abide by U.S. copyright laws when referencing or using others' content in any materials.
- Follow the [Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) Guide](https://www.opm.gov/about-us/open-government/digital-government-strategy/fitara/paperwork-reduction-act-guide.pdf) before sending out a survey or other requests for feedback, especially if your community includes members of the public (non-government).
- Use plain language: If you are unfamiliar with plain language, think about [joining the community](https://digital.gov/communities/plain-language/), [attending one of our Plain Language CoP meetings](https://digital.gov/events/), or [check out our resources](https://digital.gov/topics/plain-language/). You can also visit [PlainLanguage.gov](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/) where you can learn about the Plain Writing Act of 2010 requirements. Please use correct spelling and grammar so that all can participate.
- Grammar and fonts: Please spell-check your messages. Use correct spelling (use the word _you_, not the letter _u_, and the word _are_, not the letter _r_). Please use 12-point, black text in an easy to read font&mdash;such as [Times New Roman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_New_Roman) or [Helvetica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetica).
- Please be patient: Digital.gov CoP members have different experience levels. You may consider some of the conversation threads on a particular topic simple, but they are fundamental for people to learn.
- Practice constructive criticism: Please review your language when participating in conversation. Engage in conversation by articulating your thoughts. Abide by, “if you have nothing nice to say, don’t say it at all!” Read your comments over before pressing send.
- Stay organized: Please keep the conversation threads focused. Start a new thread if it does not pertain to the latest conversation.
- Be brief: Try to be direct and stay on point as much as possible.

## Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)
The Communities of Practice are hosted by digital.gov, a service of the Technology Transformation Services (TTS) within the General Services Administration (GSA). GSA is a federal agency subject to the [Freedom of Information Act](https://www.foia.gov/) and must comply with requests for records made under FOIA. As a result, all communications made on this Communities of Practice LISTSERV are subject to release under FOIA.

## Listserv Information

When sending a message to the entire Listserv, consider that your message is going to hundreds or even thousands of people. Below, please find some general rules and guidelines when participating in a Digital.gov CoP LISTSERV discussion.

### How to join a Listserv

Government employees (with a .gov or .mil email address) are encouraged to join any communities of practice that relate to your work. [Visit our Communities page]({{< ref "/communities" >}}) to see all the communities and learn how to join.
