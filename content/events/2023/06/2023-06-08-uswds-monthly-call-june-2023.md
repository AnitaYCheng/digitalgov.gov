Join us as we talk about the easy-to-follow, manual accessibility and user experience (UX) tests we're developing for U.S. Web Design System ([USWDS) components](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/). We’re calling these tests `Critical Checklists`.

In this session, you’ll learn how we're approaching `Critical Checklists`:

* Our vision for `Critical Checklists`
* How `Critical Checklists` address [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) requirements
* How we're evaluating checklist content
* How `Critical Checklists` can support your own accessibility testing

**This event is best suited for:** Designers, developers, and accessibility specialists at all levels
