Join the Design System team as we take a step back and explore how our design decisions both support and are supported by the ways our bodies and brains perceive order and make sense of the world.

In this session, you’ll learn how to: 

* How does grouping affect perception?
* What is cognitive load?
* How can we use principles of cognition in the service of design decisions?

**This event is best suited for:** Designers of all levels

## Speakers

* **Dan Williams -** Product Lead, USWDS

*This event is part of a monthly series that takes place on the third Thursday of each month. Don’t forget to set a placeholder on your personal calendar for our future events this year.*
