In 2015, General Services Administration’s Technology Transformation Services (TTS) created “Inclusion Bot” to help staff use more inclusive and thoughtful language in everyday communications.

Over time, the team found this bot could use some improvements. So starting in 2019, they began conducting research and iterating on the bot to further their goal of a welcoming, inclusive culture.

This event is best suited for [Communicators](https://digital.gov/communities/communicators/) at all levels of experience, from beginners to experts. Those who work in related fields such as accessibility, DEIA, social media, open data and open source will also benefit from attending.

In this session, you’ll learn about:

* Use technology to promote more inclusive language in the workplace.
* Establish a common language and clear workplace expectations.
* Build a shared understanding of concepts, values, and norms that are essential in building inclusive teams.
* Implement inclusive automation.
* Make iterative improvements to inclusion automation, including the words that trigger a reminder.
