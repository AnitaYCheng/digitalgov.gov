Where does the design system go from USWDS 2.0? What did we learn from that release? What challenges can the design system better address as we move forward? How can the design system be ready to grow and evolve alongside the teams that use it? 

Join Dan Williams for the next USWDS Monthly Call, Thursday, September 16 from 2-3pm ET, to hear what the design system team is thinking, as we peer into the crystal ball and look into the future.

*This event is part of a monthly series that takes place on the third Thursday of each month. Donâ€™t forget to set a placeholder on your personal calendar for our future events this year.*
