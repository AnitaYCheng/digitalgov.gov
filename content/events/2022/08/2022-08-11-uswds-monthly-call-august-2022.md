What are design patterns and how do they fit into the design system? Join us to learn more about USWDS Inclusive Design Patterns — upcoming guidance that will help connect components to common service interactions. We’ll preview this upcoming guidance and discuss the process we used to develop it.

*This event is part of a monthly series that takes place on the third Thursday of each month. Don’t forget to set a placeholder on your personal calendar for our future events this year.*
