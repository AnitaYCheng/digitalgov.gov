How do we help users find content in their preferred language? Join us as we take a closer look at the language selection patterns we're developing for USWDS. We'll talk about how this work evolved out of the [Multilingual Community of Practice](https://digital.gov/communities/multilingual/), then we'll discuss our general approach to pattern guidance while looking at this specific guidance and the new components that support it.

*This event is part of a monthly series that takes place on the third Thursday of each month. Don’t forget to set a placeholder on your personal calendar for our future events this year.*
