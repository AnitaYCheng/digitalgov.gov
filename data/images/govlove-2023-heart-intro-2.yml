Along the bottom are a blue and white postage stamp image with the hashtag Gov Love on the left, and the Digital.gov logo on the right. Within the big blue heart is white text that reads, We're spreading the #GovLove with Performance.gov this week to celebrate public servants like you! Prepare your hearts to be warmed."
